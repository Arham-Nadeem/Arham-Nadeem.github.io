                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <p>Growing up in Chicago, I wasn't initially drawn to technology. My parents, who immigrated to Chicago for a better life for their children, didn't have much exposure to education or technology. As a result, our family life had little room for tech. However, as my siblings and I grew older, we began to realize the potential and usefulness of technology.</p>
                        <p>My first real encounter with computer science happened in high school. I enrolled in a computer science course simply to fulfill a graduation requirement, but I was surprised to find the coursework fascinating. The ability to break down complex technological phenomena into understandable bits of code captivated me. It was as if the mysterious workings of technology were finally being unraveled before my eyes.</p>
                        <p>Encouraged by this newfound interest, I enrolled in a gaming course next. As a video game enthusiast, I was thrilled to learn how to code games. This experience completely changed my perception of coding, transforming it from a mere academic requirement into a passionate hobby. Coding became "fun" for me, a creative outlet where I could bring my ideas to life.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, my high school didn't offer advanced placement (AP) or college credit courses in computer science. This left me feeling unprepared and insecure when I started university, where many of my peers seemed far more experienced and knowledgeable. However, this sense of being behind only fueled my determination to catch up and excel.</p>
                        <p>I immersed myself in my studies, rekindling my interest in data science and software engineering. Starting with a foundation in Python, I challenged myself to learn additional languages and coding systems. Through hard work and perseverance, I expanded my technical skills and deepened my understanding of the field.</p>
